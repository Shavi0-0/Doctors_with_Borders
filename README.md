# Doctors_with_Borders
The goal of the project was to create a Database for my Database Systems class.

Overview:
This project involves the comprehensive design and implementation of a database for a hospital setting, covering various aspects from the initial Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to the practical implementation using MariaDB. The objective is to build a well-structured database that accurately represents hospital operations.

a. Final Design:
Completed the final design phase, incorporating ER diagrams, ER dictionaries, Schema Diagram, and Schema Dictionary.
Ensured a visually appealing and error-free final design document, meeting the specified project requirements.

b. Data Generation:
Addressed the need for database population, emphasizing the importance of accurately representing a hospital database.
Defined the size of each relational table, justifying decisions based on practical constraints and system limitations.
Implemented data generation using a Python script with Mockaroo and ChatGPT, ensuring an efficient and realistic data population.

c. Database Implementation:
Utilized draw.io for ER diagram creation, leveraging its free features and user-friendly templates.
Chose MariaDB for database implementation due to its open-source nature and user-friendly GUI.
Effectively navigated challenges in MariaDB debugging, demonstrating adaptability and problem-solving skills.

d. Collaboration and Documentation:
Collaborated seamlessly within the cohort to ensure each member's contribution aligned with overall project goals.
Demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of database design principles, SQL scripting, and collaborative project execution.

How to Use:
1. ER Diagrams:
ER diagrams, dictionaries, Schema Diagram, and Schema Dictionary are available in the respective folders.

2. Data Generation:
The Python script for data generation is provided in the "Data Generation" folder.
Ensure Mockaroo and ChatGPT are set up for optimal script execution.
3. Database Implementation:
MariaDB scripts for table creation and database implementation can be found in the "MariaDB Scripts" folder.
Follow instructions in the scripts for proper execution.

Collaboration:
Cohort members can collaborate using collaborative tools such as draw.io for design discussions and project planning.
